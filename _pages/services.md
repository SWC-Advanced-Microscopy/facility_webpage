## Available equipment at UCL
Our researchers also have access to equipment elsewhere at UCL, in particular we have links with the [UCL Biosciences Imaging Facility](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/research/research-facilities/ucl-biosciences-imaging-facility). 
Equipment there includes spinning disk, high content screening, micro CT, and super resolution (SIM, PALM, STORM).


## We offer a range of services including:
* Training and assistance on confocal and wide-field fluorescence microscopy.
* General histology as a service: sectioning, mounting, IHC, RNAscope, H&E, etc.
* Automated slide-scanning.
* Automated, high-throughput, serial section 2-photon imaging of whole organs.
* Advice on tissue clearing and lightsheet microscopy. 
* _In vivo_ functional imaging: assistance, microscopy upgrades, and maintenance.
* Advice on data analysis and microscope hardware.
* Assistance with construction of custom equipment for any imaging-related project.
* Help with programming data-acquisition devices. 
* Management assistance for microscopy-related projects that span multiple SWC core facilities.

Our staff has broad experience. e.g. Want to know about super-resolution? We have staff with experience!



## Analysis
We can help you analyse data in Python, MATLAB, Fiji, [napari](https://napari.org/stable/), or R.
We have experience with packages such as [Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/), [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/), and, of course, the [BrainGlobe suite](brainglobe.info). 
We can also help to make movies for talks using [Imaris](https://imaris.oxinst.com).
