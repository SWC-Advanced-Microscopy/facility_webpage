Our staff has a wide experience base. e.g. Want to know about super-resolution? We have staff with experience!

## Who can use the Facility?
The AMF primarily caters for scientists within the SWC. 
Since we also conduct a lot of internal technique development, we do not have the bandwidth to take on significant numbers of external samples.
However, we can assist with generating very small quantities of pilot data and can also assist with technology transfer: helping external groups to build our tools.  

## Getting started
1. Attend the Facility Induction and laser safety training. These take place on the first Tuesday of each month at 09:45. Just turn up: no need to book. We start promptly and if you are late you have to wait until the next session. 
2. Start an account on the [PPMS Microscope Booking System](https://ppms.eu/ucl-swc/login/?pf=2). (Login id must be prefixed with "ad\" like this: "ad\tomo")
3. Come and talk to us about your needs and we will train you as appropriate. 

## Analysis
We can help you analyse data in Python, MATLAB, Fiji, Napari, or R. 
In addition, we have experience with packages such as Ilastik, and QuPath.  
We can also help to make movies for talks using Imaris. 


## Where are we?
The AMF is located within the SWC in basement level 2, next to the NRF.
