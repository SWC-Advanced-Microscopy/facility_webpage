## Where is the Imaging Facility?
The facility is located in the SWC on Level B2, immediately to the left as you come out of the lifts.

## Is there an induction?
There is a facility intro along with the Laser Safety session on the **first Tuesday of each month starting at 09:45 sharp**. 
If you are late you will miss it. 
You do not need to book, just turn up. 
The session takes place in the Facility.

## How do I do the laser safety course?
We run a Laser Safety session and image facility intro on the **first Tuesday of each month starting at 09:45 sharp**. 
If you are late you will miss it. 
You do not need to book, just turn up to the Facility. 


## How do I book/use the equipment?
You must start an account on our [Microscope Booking System](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/SWC/Microscope+Booking), attend our monthly induction, and also be trained on the equipment you wish to use. 
Contact us (ideally come down in person) to get trained.


## Do you take samples from external users?
The AMF primarily caters for scientists within the SWC. 
Since we also conduct a lot of internal technique development, we do not have the bandwidth to take on significant numbers of external samples.
However:
1. We can generate small quantities of pilot data.
2. We can assist with technology transfer: helping external groups to build our tools.  
3. We are very open to collaborations with external groups or facilities. 



## Where do I store my data?
We strongly recommend data are stored on one of the managed servers managed by the SWC Scientific Computing team. 
Data on these are backed up to tape and the hardware is well monitored, so this are the safest place to keep your data. 
We also strongly suggest you adhere to the following guidelines:

* Store data in your group's shared directory rather than in your own personal user folder. Data kept in your user folder are only visible to you. 
* Include your initials in the file names of your images, acquisitions (e.g. brainsaw acquisitions), or the lowest level folder that holds the images. This helps trace who produced what. 
* Store images in a sensible directory structure. e.g. `./margrie/projects/MVF_2023_ThreePhotonValidation/BrainSaw`
* Data on the server are backed up to tape. Renaming the folder housing the data or moving the data to a new location **will spawn a new backup**. Please, therefore, try to settle on a suitable folder structure in advance in order to minimize the creation of redundant backups by subsequently moving data around. Avoid routinely placing data in "temporary" locations on the server before moving it on to a final location.
