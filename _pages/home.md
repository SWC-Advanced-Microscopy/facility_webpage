The Advanced Microscopy Facility (AMF) is the imaging core facility of the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/), UCL.
The AMF runs the microscopes and pipelines through which all the Centre's microscopy samples are processed. 
We focus on high-throughput, automated, solutions that are customised for the needs of our researchers. 
We design, build, upgrade, and repair a variety of custom equipment throughout the SWC.
Our tools are designed in the open and used by researchers worldwide.
