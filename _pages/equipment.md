    title: "BrainSaw: automated serial-sectioning"
    excerpt: "We have three 'BrainSaw' automated serial section microscopes. Data are 
      acquired using [ScanImage](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/products/scanimage) and 
      [BakingTray](https://bakingtray.mouse.vision/). Each microscope can accommodate up to 6 
      brains, which are sliced and imaged together. Applications include mapping electrode 
      tracks, tracing bulk projections, and automated cell counting. 
      The systems have up to four channels and can generally handle up to three fluorophores simultaneously.

    title: "MesoSPIM: whole-brain lightsheet imaging"
    excerpt: "The MesoSPIM is a macroscope-based lightsheet microscope with axial sweeping
       of the beam waist, to allow for uniform resolution across large fields of view. 
       Whole mouse brains easily fit inside the microscope. At lower resolutions no tile 
       scanning is required, making the microscope very fast. The system is compatible with
       any clearing technique. Users are responsible for clearing their own samples, but 
       we can provide protocols and advice.

    title: "Leica SP8 Confocal"
    excerpt: "Our Leica SP8 confocal has a white light laser with software-tunable excitation filter and three software-tunable detectors (2x HyD and 1x PMT). Leica's software is easy to use and comes with a slide-scanning extension.

    excerpt: "The Zeiss Axioscan slide scanner is a widefield microscope that accepts up to 100 slides and is able to image them largely automatically. We run this microscope alongside our histology service, but it can also be booked and used independently of this service.

    title: "Widefield microscopes"
    excerpt: "We have two [Zeiss Imagers](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/light-microscopes/widefield-microscopes/axio-imager-2-for-life-science-research.html), equipped with [Apotomes](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/light-microscopes/widefield-microscopes/apotome-3.html) for optical sectioning. 
      These microscopes are ideal for imaging small numbers of slides interactively. 
      We also have one [Zeiss Axiozoom](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/light-microscopes/stereo-and-zoom-microscopes/axio-zoom-v16-for-biology.html) for imaging larger fields of view.

# Functional Imaging
The AMF helps manage *in vivo* multi-photon microscopes across the building. 
Among other equipment, we manage a [Thorlabs MesoScope](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10646), three 3-photon microscopes, and a [Mini2p](https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli/mini2p). 

# Available equipment at UCL
Our researchers also have access to equipment elsewhere at UCL, in particular we have links with the [UCL Biosciences Imaging Facility](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/research/research-facilities/ucl-biosciences-imaging-facility). 
Equipment there includes spinning disk, high content screening, micro CT, and super resolution (SIM, PALM, STORM).
