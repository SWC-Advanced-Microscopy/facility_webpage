## Visualisation Tools
- [Napari](https://napari.org/) - Fast visualisation of big image data in Python
- [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) - You can use virtual stacks or the BigDataViewer to navigate large datasets
- [Icy](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/) - Fiji alternative
- [ClearVolume](https://imagej.net/ClearVolume) - Fiji plugin for making pretty transparent volumes.
- [spimagine](https://github.com/maweigert/spimagine) - Volume renderer
- [Fluorender](http://www.sci.utah.edu/software/fluorender.html) - 3D volume renderer aimed at neuroscientists. Probably can't handle large datasets.
- [VAA3D](http://home.penglab.com/proj/vaa3d/home/index.html) - Multi-dimensional data viewer for big datasets. Can be hard to set up but is powerful.
- [MIB](http://mib.helsinki.fi/index.html) - General purpose MATLAB-based viewer for quick visualisations. No big data options. 
- [Knossos](https://knossos.app/) - Big data image annotator
- [Orbit](http://www.orbit.bio/) - Image analysis tool
- [Free Imaris Viewer](https://imaris.oxinst.com/imaris-viewer) - Imaris now have a stripped down version that is free


## Analysis Tools
- [BrainGlobe](https://brainglobe.info/) - Rich suite of tools for analysing whole-brain imaging data. This toolkit is developed at the SWC with the help of international collaborators. 
- [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) - Whole slide analysis
- [ABBA](https://biop.github.io/ijp-imagetoatlas/registration.html) - Register brain slice images to the Allen Atlas.


## Useful stuff
