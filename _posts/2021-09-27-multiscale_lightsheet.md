Check out this [this new study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8497830/) combining serial sectioning with lightsheet microscopy. 
The system uses period sectioning to ensure that imaging and lightsheet penetration are always modest, in order to ensure more consistent imaging quality across the whole sample. 
Reported resolutions for brain-wide imaging are in the cellular (3 μm × 3 μm × 8 μm) to sub-micron (0.3 μm × 0.3 μm × 1 μm) ranges. 
The authors report a few different datasets, including tracing of whole, sparsely labelled, neurons.   
Code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/NeuralCircuits-Behavior/Zhang-Yao-Yin-et-al-2021/). 
It is written in MATLAB but is not laid out in a way that it could be easily set up by a third party.
