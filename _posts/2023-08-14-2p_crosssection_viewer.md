The 2-photon cross-sections of flourescent dyes need to be measured experimentally.
The term "cross-section" describes the probability with which a fluorophore can undergo 2-photon excitation as a function of wavelength.
The units are in Goeppert-Mayers (GM), named after Maria Goeppert-Mayer, the discoverer of the 2-photon effect. 
[This web app](https://SWC-Advanced-Microscopy.github.io/2p_crosssection_viewer/) allows you to interact with the cross-section data. 

Data come from the Zipfel Lab and from papers by Mikhail Drobizhev. 
Mikhail kindly provided CSV files.
